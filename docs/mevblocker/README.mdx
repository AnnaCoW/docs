MEV Blocker's Order Flow Auction protects users from the worst types of MEV while rebating up to 90% of any backrunning opportunity their transactions create.

Instead of sending transactions to the Ethereum public mempool, MEV Blocker's private mempool offers several advantages to users:

* **MEV Protection**: Transactions sent to the public pool are subject to all sorts of MEV attacks such as [frontrunning](https://blog.cow.fi/what-is-frontrunning-b2641ad7af21) and [sandwich attacks](https://blog.cow.fi/what-is-a-sandwich-attack-and-how-can-you-protect-yourself-b101c9a9b9b3), which are responsible for hundreds of [millions of dollars of value lost each week](https://eigenphi.io/mev/ethereum/sandwich). By using MEV Blocker's private pool, all transactions are protected from these attacks.

* **MEV Rebates**: Searchers connected to MEV Blocker bid for the right to backrun user transactions using "append-only" bundles. 90% of these bids are rebated to the transaction originator. The remaining 10% incentivizes builders and validators to quickly include the bundle in the PBS auction. Rebates are a great way to avoid leaking value through the supply chain and get cashback for your transactions. These rebates can also be an extremely powerful way for wallets or dApp solvers to capture value and generate extra revenue (to learn more about MEV Blocker rebates, check out the [OFA explainer page](https://docs.cow.fi/mevblocker/concepts/order-flow-auction)).

* **Faster Inclusion over other RPCs**:  MEV Blocker private pool forwards transactions directly to all major builders, yielding a faster inclusion rate (compared to sending transactions to the public mempool).

* **Multiple Endpoints**: MEV Blocker provides three different RPC endpoints catering to different needs (learn more [here](https://docs.cow.fi/mevblocker/concepts/endpoints)). 

* **Transparency**: MEV Blocker's [Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/cowprotocol/mev-blocker)
tracks all transactions submitted through the MEV Blocker RPC: transactions in detail, searchers' bids, and rebates.

## Why Integrate MEV Blocker?


* **Low Latency and Fast Inclusion Time**: With a strong builder network, MEV Blocker acts as a builder aggregator, forwarding transactions directly to the network of all the major builders. Over 90% of transactions are processed in the next block, typically within 12 seconds.

* **Superior Rebates**: With its robust searchers' competition, MEV Blocker generated at least 10x more rebates than any other competitor solutions with over 1000 ETH rebated to date.

* **Simple and No Cost to Integrate**: MEV Blocker is built by experts to be user-friendly, easy to set up, and no cost to integrate.
