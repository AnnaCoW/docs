# Sample Test Instances

In this section, we provide sample instances following the json format described in the previous sections, along with the optimal solution, again in the appropriate json format. These can be used for testing purposes while developing a solver. We clarify that the solutions provided are optimal up to a very small factor (caused by rounding very small amounts).\
